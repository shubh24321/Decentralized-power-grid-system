# Decentralized-power-grid-system
This is my internship project in NIT Warangal- Here, we create a communication channel between the generators to teach them how to share equal loads in response to changes in the loads, such as when the refrigerator or air conditioner in the house uses more electricity, show the generator, talk about it, and supply that power.
